    "## Disease Background:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your assigned disease, fill in the following bullet points. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Prevalence & incidence\n",
    "    * COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019. The virus spread rapidly within China and then worldwide through sustained human-to-human transmission, leading the WHO to declare a pandemic in March 2020. By 10 November 2024 more than 776 million confirmed cases and over 7 million confirmed deaths had been reported to WHO globally, though true infections are believed to be higher because of under-ascertainment, and COVID-19 has shifted from acute pandemic waves to an endemic pattern with lower but persistent incidence. China initially kept incidence relatively low through “zero-COVID” controls, but after these measures were lifted in 2022, the country experienced massive Omicron waves from roughly November 2022 through mid-2023, with modeling studies suggesting very rapid nationwide spread and analyses of excess mortality estimating on the order of 1–2 million additional deaths in just the first two months after the policy change.\n",
    "* Economic burden\n",
    "    * COVID had a significant economic burden on the global scale. As sickness and quarantine inhibited the productivity of nearly every organization, the global market plummeted and a recession ensued. Specifically in China, several \"Zero-COVID\" policies, including transportation and public space support. As a result of the pandemic in China in the year 2022, the country lost 4% of its GDP. Loss of productivity due to a detrimented workforce in China caused a national recession in China. The cost of living increased drastically, placing a financial burden on Chinese citizens.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Risk factors (genetic, lifestyle) & Societal determinants\n",
    "    * The primary risk factor associated with COVID was direct contact with infected individuals. Thus, those prone to frequent human contact, including those who worked at customer-facing businesses and employees of the state (law enforcement, fire and rescue), were at high risk. Other risk factors include being immunocompromised (conditions including cancers, heart and lung diseases, obesity) and those of older ages. Vaccination, including primary and booster doses, helps to reduce risk of infection of COVID.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Symptoms\n",
    "    * Symptoms of COVID often mimic those of the common cold: Fever, chills, SOB, sore throat, congestion, loss of sense of taste or smell, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and vertigo (CDC). Symptoms are often more severe for those who are immunocompromised and those of older age. Some individuals may not experience any symptoms but still are a \"carrier\" of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Diagnosis\n",
    "    * There are two main forms of diagnosis for COVID. One accurate method of diagnosis is PCR tests, which look at genetic material from human samples in order to identify presence of the disease. PCR tests are frequently completed by healthcare professionals in laboratories. Another form of diagnosis is antigen testing, also known as \"rapid\" testing. These tests detect presence of antigens in a sample. They are much faster than PCR tests (and so are often done at home), but their results are much less reliable. The FDA recommends that if one attains a positive antigen test result that they wait two days and then repeat testing to confirm results.\n",
    "     \n",
    "* Biological mechanisms (anatomy, organ physiology, cell & molecular physiology)\n",
    "    * SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, binds to the ACE2 receptor, which is expressed on epithelial cells in the nasal passages, lungs, gut, heart, kidneys, and several other tissues. After attachment, the virus enters cells and triggers cytopathic effects and an immune response. In the respiratory tract, infection of type II alveolar cells disrupts surfactant production and impairs gas exchange, contributing to hypoxemia. The innate immune system responds with interferons and inflammatory cytokines, and in severe cases, dysregulation of this response leads to exaggerated inflammation, vascular leakage, microthrombosis, and multiorgan involvement. This response explains complications such as pulmonary embolisms, myocarditis, and kidney injury.\n",
